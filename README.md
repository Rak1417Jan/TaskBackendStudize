# Task: Backend Development for Studize

The task is divided into the following parts:

### Part 1: Creating a Basic Webpage
- **Authentication Page**: The first page should include authentication options (Sign In, Sign Up, Logout).
- **Questionnaire Page**: After authentication, the user is directed to a questionnaire page for SOCA (Strengths, Opportunities, Challenges, Action Plan). [Refer to the video in the repository for a sample].
- **API Integration**: The questionnaire responses are sent to an API, and a response is received from the API.

### Part 2: API Integration
- The questionnaire answers are sent to the API, and the response is received and handled.

### Part 3: Database Creation
- **User Authentication Data**: Save the user authentication details in the backend.
- **SOCA Responses**: Store the SOCA responses under the user's private key in the backend.

### Part 4: Displaying Response History
- **SOCA History Page**: Create another webpage to retrieve and display the SOCA responses generated by the user.
- **Timestamping**: Ensure that all generated SOCA responses are stored with their respective date and time, and retrieve them on the SOCA history page.

### Note
- Using a cloud database with NoSQL, such as Firebase or Supabase, is highly recommended.
- The entry level API code is shared in the repository , refer that for creating the API call function and you see "hello" written you have to basically pass the user SOCA responses instead of "hello" for each entry.
